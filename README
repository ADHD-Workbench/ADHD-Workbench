# ADHD-Workbench
ADHD Workbench is a collection of self-management tools for those with ADHD.

The ADHD Workbench is both the name of the complete software collection, as well as the basic workbench view itself. The name “workbench” should imply what it means, a workbench or dedicated desktop. A two-dimensional tiled  space containing “tools” or “widgets” (tiles representing displays, reports or applications). Each widget contains a report summary or other pertinent relevant information and click throughs to reports and the related application.

Example workbench applications include:

- ADHD symptom journal
- Habit tracker
- Pomodoro timer
- CBT and CBT/Schema therapy forms
- Basic ADHD daily journal
